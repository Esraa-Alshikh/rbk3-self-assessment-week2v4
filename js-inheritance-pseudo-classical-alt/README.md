## Pseudo-classical inheritance
* [ ] Rewrite `makeHorse` and `makeFlyingHorse` to use pseudo-classical inheritance
  * They must have all of the same methods as objects returned from the maker functions
  * _Do not modify the factory functions - instead, use the constructor functions at the end of the file_

  * when you finish, commit your code with th commit "ooh"
